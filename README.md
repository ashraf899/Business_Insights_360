### **Project Overview**

AtliQ Hardware has experienced rapid growth in recent years and aims to solidify its position as a market leader. To achieve this, the company is implementing a data analytics solution using Power BI for the first time. This initiative is expected to empower stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions, giving AtliQ Hardware a competitive edge in the market.

The project focuses on addressing key questions from stakeholders across various domains, including Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain Management.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics Power BI Course. The link to the course is [here](https://codebasics.io/courses/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project).

### **Company Background**

AltiQ Hardware is a rapidly growing company that has expanded its operations globally in recent years. The company specializes in selling computers and computer accessories through three primary channels:

- **Retailers**
- **Direct Sales**
- **Distributors**

Recently, AltiQ Hardware has faced an unforeseen loss from its store opening in the United States. This setback was based on surveys, intuition, and some preliminary Excel analysis. Meanwhile, the company's competitors have a well-established analytics team to perform in-depth analysis and make data-driven decisions. 

In light of this, AltiQ Hardware recognizes the need to build its own analytics team to leverage data insights for future decision-making and to remain competitive in the industry.

### **Project Kickoff Session**

The project kickoff session aims to clearly define the objectives and goals of the project. During this session, itâ€™s crucial to answer key questions to ensure alignment and clarity for the entire team. These questions may include:

### **Questions to Ask Before Starting the Dashboard Project**

- **What is the primary objective of building this Power BI dashboard?**
- **How will the success of this project be measured (e.g., KPIs, business outcomes)?**
- **What is the expected timeline and deadline for completing the project?**
- **Do stakeholders expect to preview the dashboard before the final release? If so, when?**
- **What are the stakeholders' hopes and expectations for this project?**
- **What concerns or fears do stakeholders have regarding the development of this dashboard?**
- **Who will be using this dashboard, and what are their specific use cases or needs?**
- **What are the key expectations from stakeholders upon the completion of the project?**
- **What potential challenges or risks could arise during the development of the dashboard?**
- **What resources or data are required to successfully build this dashboard (e.g., data sources, tools)?**
- **Are there any specific inputs or preferences from stakeholders regarding the design, layout, and views of the dashboard?**

After the project kickoff meetings, the data engineering team will provide the data as per the request of the data analytics team. Let's begin exploring the provided data.

### **Importing Data into Power BI**

- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from the MySQL database to Power BI by providing the database access credentials.  

### **Data Model**

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered the foundation of the report. All visuals will be built upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.
- Following good practices of data modeling is a must. Refer to this click [here](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices) to learn more about good practices.
- In this project, we have followed Star and Snowflake data modeling method.
